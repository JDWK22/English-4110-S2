<p>Here is where I store various stories, guides, and information relating to my adventure with keyboards as a way to display my writing capabilities.</p>

<p>My most recent creation:</p>

<p>Ever since I first had access to a computer, I became infatuated with video games. Now being a relatively shy kid in the 2010's, I'm sure that notion is a surprise to absolutely nobody.</p>
<p>Through this interest in video games, my attention was naturally also directed towards other subgenre interested associated with video games. What gaming headset is the best, what gaming mouse is the best, what anything is the best. Eventually during my third year of high-school I asked a question that would fundamentally change my hobbies; what keyboard is the best?</p>
<p>As anyone in the keyboard hobby can attest, this question is impossible yet finding the answer is everyone's individual goal. A true showing of preference. It was here that I first dove into the wide realm of keyboards. To keep scope of this introduction I won't mention any of these early keyboard builds here, but from that day on I began my futile journey at finding &quot;Endgame.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="goals-with-this-repositoryhome-page">Goals with this repository/home page</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have a concrete place to store all of the mods/builds across my keyboard journey</li>
<li>Improve my conversational, documentational, and eventually instructional writing skills</li>
<li>Further my skills in markdown and HTML</li>
</ul>
